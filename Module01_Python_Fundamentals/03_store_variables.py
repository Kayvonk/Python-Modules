# 03_store_variables.py
# 📦 Let's store information using variables!

# A variable is like a labeled box that holds something.
# You can store text, numbers, or other types of data.

# 📝 Store your name in a variable
name = "Alex"

# 📝 Store your age in a variable
age = 12

# 📝 Store your favorite animal
favorite_animal = "dolphin"

# 🖨️ Now print a message using those variables
print("My name is " + name + ".")
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
print("My favorite animal is the " + favorite_animal + ".")

# 🧠 Bonus: Try combining everything in one print using an f-string!
print(f"Hi! I'm {name}, I'm {age} years old, and I love {favorite_animal}s!")

# ✨ Challenge:
# Make up a new character and store their name, hobby, and favorite emoji in variables.
# Then print a short introduction for them.

# Example:
character_name = "Zara"
hobby = "drawing"
emoji = "🎨"

print(f"{character_name} loves {hobby}! {emoji}")
