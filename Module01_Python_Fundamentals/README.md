# Module 01: Python Fundamentals 🐍

## 🧠 Overview
Welcome to your first Python module! In this module, you'll learn how to talk to your computer using code. We'll start with the basics like printing messages, working with text and numbers, and storing information in variables. By the end, you'll be able to build a small interactive project using everything you've learned.

This module builds the foundation for everything you’ll do later — including building real web servers using Python and Flask!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use the `print()` function to display text (and emojis 😄!)
- Create and use **variables** to store numbers and text
- Collect **user input** using `input()`
- Understand **data types**: strings, integers, floats, and booleans
- Perform **basic math** in Python
- Use **string concatenation** and f-strings to format output
- Write and run simple Python programs

## 🧪 Tips

- You can run any file by typing `python filename.py` in your terminal or running it directly in Replit.
- Experiment! Change values, add emojis, or invent silly messages.
- Don't worry if you make mistakes — errors are how we learn.
