# 🗄️ What is a database?

# A database is a place to store data in an organized way.
# It helps apps remember things even after they close.

# Examples of data stored in databases:
# - User accounts
# - Messages
# - Product info
# - Game scores

# Databases organize data into tables, like spreadsheets,
# with rows and columns.

print("Databases help us store and manage data efficiently!")

# 🧠 Think about:
# What kind of data would you want to store in a web app?
# Write down a few examples.
