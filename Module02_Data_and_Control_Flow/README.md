# Module 02: Data and Control Flow 🔁

## 🧠 Overview
Now that you know how to print messages and use variables, it's time to level up! In this module, you'll learn how to make decisions with `if` statements, repeat actions using loops, and store multiple pieces of data using **lists** and **dictionaries** — all essential skills for building real programs and APIs.

These tools will help you write smart programs that can respond to users, remember things, and do things more than once.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow
- Compare values using `==`, `<`, `>`, `!=`, etc.
- Use `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions
- Create and manipulate **lists**
- Create and access **dictionaries**
- Use **Boolean logic** (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Build small programs that react to user input and store data
