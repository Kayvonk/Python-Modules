# 04_list_loops.py
# ðŸ”„ Let's loop through lists using 'for' loops!

# You can repeat actions for every item in a list.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Print each fruit one by one
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# ðŸŽ¯ Your turn:
# Create a list of your favorite colors and print each one using a for loop

colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

for color in colors:
    print(color)

# âœ¨ Bonus Challenge:
# Print each color in uppercase letters

for color in colors:
    print(color.upper())

# âœ… Try changing the lists and loops to practice!
